# Chord
Code containing the implementation of Chord protocol which manages a Distributed Hash Table (DHT). The implemetation can handle node join and unexpected node cuts in a decentralized manner. 

The code works on Virtual machines or real machines connected to the same LAN network.
Used XMLRPC calls for procedure execution.


This implementation is based on the following paper : `https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1180543`

The main file to lookout for is `ChordRPC.py` which can be run on indiviudual hosts.
